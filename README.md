## üîÑ Team Overview

Our team is focused on developing an intelligent application, **IBS (Indonesia Bebas Sampah)**, which aims to classify and detect types of waste using machine learning technology. The application is designed to help users identify waste categories, promoting efficient waste management and recycling practices. By leveraging advanced image classification techniques, we strive to support environmental sustainability efforts.
