## üîÑ Team Overview

Our team is focused on developing an intelligent application, **IBS (Indonesia Bebas Sampah)**, which aims to classify and detect types of waste using machine learning technology. The application is designed to help users identify waste categories, promoting efficient waste management and recycling practices. By leveraging advanced image classification techniques, we strive to support environmental sustainability efforts.

## üìÅ Dataset Details

### Location:

The dataset is stored on Google Drive. Access the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mh2Ajk_D3TiEqro-kyo1glBbxEU2wpHu?usp=sharing).

### Structure:

- **Source:** Custom dataset organized into categories for classification.
- **Categories:** Images are grouped into folders based on their labels.
- **Size:** Optimized for ML training and testing purposes.

### Folder Structure:

```
/dataset
  |-- category1/
  |-- category2/
  |-- ...
```

### Example Files:

| File Name    | Description        |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| `category1/` | Folder for Class 1 |
| `category2/` | Folder for Class 2 |
| ...          | ...                |
